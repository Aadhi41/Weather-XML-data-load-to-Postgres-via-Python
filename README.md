# Weather-XML-data-load-to-Postgres-via-Python
This script describes the process to obtain an XML format data which consist of weather data from an URL and insert into Postgres table

##Overview
This project is to extract Australia Weather Data from Australian Weather website. 
As the format is in XML, I will need to load the data into XML Treee and then parse it into variables.
As each data in the XML is stored into variable, I can then push it into Postgres database for further analytics.
